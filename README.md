# Breast Cancer Segmentation using U-Net

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Segmentation using U-Net project applies the U-Net architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN), for accurately segmenting and identifying regions of interest within medical imaging data. Primarily focused on mammograms or breast ultrasound images, the project aims to provide a robust segmentation model for the precise identification of suspicious lesions or tumors, contributing to early and accurate breast cancer diagnosis.
